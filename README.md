# GAZE-POINTER
Our project the ‘Gaze Pointer’ is an application that will be very helpful to ‘Amputees’ in controlling the mouse by using just the eye gestures and facial expressions. 

The benefits of using our project are as follows:

•	Easier computer control.

•	Help disabled & handicapped people to use computer.

•	Helpful in commercial interactive games and advertisements.

•	This can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of human-computer interaction by reducing the need for physical movement and clicks.

•	It can help improve the overall user experience of digital devices by providing more intuitive and natural ways of interaction.

•	Eye-controlled mouse technology can be used in education to create more engaging and interactive learning experiences, such as allowing students to navigate digital content or interact with virtual simulations.
